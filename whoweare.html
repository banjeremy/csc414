<h1>About the Game and the Game Makers</h1>
<h3>SNIPER SMURKS...Some crazy colored smurks all landed on some desolate island and they all happened to have guns that are currently invisible.  Your goal... be the last smurk standing!</h3>
<h3>Jeremy Jones, Aaron Stricklin, Brandon Wolfe, and Lauren Sears are members of the Software Engineering I class at the University of Southern Mississipi class of 2012, except Brandon who is in the class of 2013.  Our class was split into teams and taskedwith creating a video game in 8 weeks and this was the result of all our hard work!</h3>
<h4>Ackknowledgements THREE.js, Blender, easywebsocket, espeak, and jaCob for no reason.<h4>
